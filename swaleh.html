<p>He is a first year student at The Technical University of Kenya pursuing a bachelor in Economics.</p>
<p>Swaleh was recently elected as the school representative of the school of social science and development studies for the Muslim Association.</p>
<p>He was elected due to his vision and urge to unite Muslims and also bring a change in the association.</p>
<p>Swaleh has participated in leadership training events for instance The Grip Leadership Training and also he has been trained by Serein Education Centre on leadership.</p>
<p>He is currently learning Spanish and Arabic.</p>
<p>He has a passion of working with the youths and enabling them to live their dream.</p>
<p>As youths we have great dreams but as problems hit us, we lost our dreams also.</p>
<p>I believe for a better Kenya the youths should be empowered.</p>
<p>This makes me to think of starting a Youth program for the youths to bring solution to their problem and start living their dreams.</p>
<p>Swaleh also has passion for the street children because they need my help and your to get out the street.</p>
<p>If they were taken to school or allowed to explore their talent would they be on streets?</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s economic force that is being wasted out there.</p>
<p>He strives to use his course and ideas to bring a change to the lives of the street children</p>
<p>He believes in for a better tomorrow it should be built right now.</p>
